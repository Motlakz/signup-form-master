See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
Any input field is empty. The message for this error should say "[Field Name] cannot be empty" otherwise the broswer default will automatically activate.
The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: name@host.tld). The message for this error should say "Looks like this is not an email"

What I learned
I learned a little bit about JS form validation although it didn't work because the default kciked in.

Continued development
I would like to dig a little deeper into my media queries, get comfortable with CSS Flexbox and Grid, as well as proceed with my basic JS and master all the foundations accordingly. will continue to apply these in future projects to get a good feel on them.

Useful resources
W3Schools - This helped me with my form validation, box-shadow and media queries. Always the best teacher.
